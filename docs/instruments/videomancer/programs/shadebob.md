## Overview

**Shadebob** is a synthesis program that recreates the classic Amiga demoscene "shadebob" effect. A radial color blob: the ***bob***: moves along a ***Lissajous*** trajectory and is additively composited onto a persistent low-resolution framebuffer. As the bob travels, it leaves behind a trail of color that slowly fades over time, painting flowing ribbons of light across the screen.

The framebuffer is a 64×36 grid of 8-bit cells backed by block RAM. Each cell stores an intensity value that maps into a 256-entry rainbow palette, producing vivid spectral colors from red through violet. A separate hue framebuffer records the palette index at the moment each cell is stamped, enabling two distinct decay modes: a rainbow trail where each segment retains its original hue, and a monochromatic trail where the entire pattern shifts color in unison.

At low decay rates, Shadebob builds up dense, overlapping color fields that fill the screen with luminous tapestries. At high decay rates, the bob leaves only a brief comet tail. The Lissajous trajectory creates endlessly varying orbital paths that never quite repeat, ensuring the pattern evolves continuously.

Shadebob generates its own imagery: no video input is required. Connect a video source and enable **Mod Vid** to modulate the bob's brightness with the incoming picture.

### What's In a Name?

The name ***Shadebob*** comes directly from the Amiga demoscene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. A ***shade bob*** (or ***shadebobs***) was a classic demo effect where a small colored shape: the "bob": was drawn additively onto the screen, leaving persistent trails that built up into complex, flowing patterns. The technique exploited the Amiga's blitter hardware to perform fast additive compositing. "Bob" is itself Amiga jargon for ***Blitter Object***, a hardware-accelerated sprite. The "shade" refers to the gradual color buildup and decay that give the trails their luminous, glowing quality.

## Quick Start

1. Turn **Speed** (Knob 1) to about 40%. A colored blob traces a smooth orbital path across the screen, leaving a fading trail behind it.
2. Adjust **Decay** (Knob 2). At low values, trails persist for many seconds, building up dense color fields. At high values, the trail vanishes almost immediately, leaving just the bob itself.
3. Turn **Hue Speed** (Knob 4) up from zero. The rainbow palette begins cycling, and the trail becomes a spectrum of shifting colors.
4. Toggle **Dual Bob** (Switch 7) to **On**. A second bob appears at the opposite point of the orbit, doubling the trail density and creating symmetrical patterns.

## Parameters

*Videomancer's front panel with Shadebob active. Knobs 1–6 (top two rows of left cluster), Toggle switches 7–11 (bottom row of left cluster), Fader 12 (right side).*

### Knob 1 — Speed

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 38% |

**Speed** controls the animation rate of the Lissajous trajectory. At 0%, the bob moves very slowly, taking many seconds to complete a single orbit. As Speed increases, the bob accelerates, tracing its path more rapidly and covering more of the framebuffer per second. At 100%, the bob races across the grid, and trails overlap densely even at high decay rates.

Speed interacts with **Ratio** (Knob 6) to determine the overall trajectory shape. At moderate speeds with a balanced ratio, the bob traces smooth figure-eight patterns. At high speeds, the trail fills the screen before decay can erase it.

---

### Knob 2 — Decay

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 13% |

**Decay** controls how quickly the framebuffer fades to black. At 0%, there is no decay at all: trails persist indefinitely and the screen gradually fills with saturated color. As Decay increases, the trail lifetime shortens. At 100%, cells fade almost instantly, and only a brief comet tail follows the bob.

:::note
Setting Decay to zero and watching the screen fill up is half the fun. Use **Reset** (Switch 9) to clear the canvas and start fresh.
:::

---

### Knob 3 — Bob Size

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 50% |

**Bob Size** sets the radius of the blob in framebuffer cells. At 0%, the bob is a small, tight dot with a radius of 2 cells. At 100%, it expands to a large disc with a radius of 9 cells that covers a substantial portion of the 64×36 grid. Larger bobs fill the framebuffer more quickly with each stamp, producing broader, more diffuse trails.

---

### Knob 4 — Hue Speed

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 25% |

**Hue Speed** controls the rate at which the rainbow palette cycles. At 0%, the palette is static and the bob stamps a single color. As Hue Speed increases, the palette rotates faster, and successive stamps lay down different hues, painting the trail in spectral bands.

In ***Hue*** decay mode (Switch 11 set to **Hue**), each cell retains the color it was given at stamp time, so cycling creates a frozen rainbow trail. In ***Luma*** decay mode, all cells share the same live hue, so the entire trail shifts color in unison as the palette cycles.

---

### Knob 5 — Bright

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 75% |

**Bright** scales the overall luminance of the synthesized output. This is a continuous 10-bit × 10-bit unsigned multiply applied after palette lookup and gamma correction. At 0%, the output is black. At 100%, the palette colors appear at full intensity. Intermediate values dim the entire pattern proportionally.

---

### Knob 6 — Ratio

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 38% |

**Ratio** biases the Lissajous trajectory between horizontal and vertical motion. At 0%, the bob moves primarily in the horizontal axis, tracing wide sweeps left and right. At 50%, horizontal and vertical speeds are balanced, producing classic figure-eight or circular orbits. At 100%, the bob moves primarily vertically. Shifting the ratio creates elliptical, diagonal, and asymmetric Lissajous figures.

:::tip
Small changes to **Ratio** produce dramatically different orbit shapes. Try sweeping it slowly while watching the trail evolve: you'll find figure eights, pretzels, and spirograph-like patterns.
:::

---

### Switch 7 — Dual Bob

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Dual Bob** enables a second bob positioned at the opposite point of the Lissajous orbit. When the first bob is at the top of its path, the second bob is at the bottom. Both bobs stamp the framebuffer every frame, doubling the trail density and creating mirror-symmetric patterns. With Dual Bob disabled, only one bob is active.

---

### Switch 8 — Shape

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Circle |
| On | Diamond |
| Default | Circle |

**Shape** selects the distance metric used to define the bob's outline. Set to **Circle**, the bob uses a precomputed ***Euclidean distance*** ROM for accurate round shapes. Set to **Diamond**, the bob uses ***Manhattan distance*** (the sum of horizontal and vertical offsets), producing diamond-shaped stamps. Diamond bobs have sharper corners and a tilted-square appearance.

---

### Switch 9 — Reset

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | Reset |
| Default | Off |

**Reset** clears the entire framebuffer to black when toggled from **Off** to **Reset**. This erases all accumulated trails instantly, giving you a blank canvas. The bob continues moving from its current position, immediately beginning to paint new trails. Reset is edge-triggered: it fires once on the transition, not continuously while held.

---

### Switch 10 — Mod Vid

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Mod Vid** enables video modulation. When active, the incoming video signal's luminance modulates the bob's brightness during the rendering pipeline. Bright areas of the input video allow the full bob intensity through; dark areas attenuate it. This stamps the input image's tonal structure onto the synthesized trail pattern, merging external video content with the Lissajous animation.

:::warning
Mod Vid requires a valid video input signal. Without one, modulation has no effect beyond slightly dimming the output.
:::

---

### Switch 11 — Decay

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Hue |
| On | Luma |
| Default | Hue |

**Decay** selects between two trail coloring modes. Set to **Hue**, each framebuffer cell retains the palette index it was given at the moment of stamping. As the palette cycles via **Hue Speed**, the trail becomes a frozen rainbow: each segment keeps its original color while new stamps take on the current hue. Set to **Luma**, all non-zero cells share the same live palette index. The entire trail shifts color together as the palette cycles, producing a monochromatic pattern that breathes through the spectrum.

---

### Fader 12 — Mix

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0% – 100% |
| Default | 100% |

**Mix** blends between the dry input signal and the wet synthesized output. At 0%, only the dry input passes through. At 100%, only the Shadebob synthesis is visible. Intermediate values overlay the bob trails onto the input video, allowing the synthesized pattern to float above the source material.

## Background

### The Amiga demoscene

The ***demoscene*** is a computer art subculture that emerged in the 1980s, centered on creating real-time audiovisual demonstrations: ***demos***: that push hardware to its limits. The Commodore Amiga was a defining platform, and the shade bob was one of its most recognizable effects. Programmers used the Amiga's dedicated graphics coprocessor (the ***Blitter***) to perform fast additive pixel compositing, stamping a small sprite onto the screen hundreds of times per frame without erasing previous stamps. The resulting trail of overlapping translucent shapes created mesmerizing, ever-shifting color patterns that became a visual signature of the era.

### Lissajous figures

A ***Lissajous figure*** is the path traced by a point whose X and Y coordinates each follow independent sinusoidal oscillations. When the two frequencies are related by a simple ratio, the path forms elegant closed curves: figure eights, circles, bow ties, and knots. When the ratio is irrational, the curve never exactly repeats, gradually filling a rectangular region. Shadebob uses two independent phase accumulators driven by **Speed** and **Ratio** to generate the bob's trajectory. The result is an endlessly evolving orbital path that sweeps across the framebuffer in complex, non-repeating patterns.

### Additive compositing and decay

Shadebob's visual character comes from the interplay between ***additive compositing*** and ***temporal decay***. Each frame, the bob stamps a flat intensity value onto every framebuffer cell within its radius, saturating at 255. Simultaneously, every non-zero cell is decremented by a configurable decay step. The result is a dynamic equilibrium: cells near the bob's current position are bright and saturated, while cells in the wake fade gradually through the palette toward black. The tension between accumulation and decay produces the glowing, phosphorescent quality of the trails.

## Signal Flow

### Signal Flow Notes

The architecture splits into two domains that operate in different time scales. The ***Lissajous engine*** runs once per vertical sync, during the blanking interval. It first decays every non-zero cell, then stamps the bob (and optionally a second bob) onto the framebuffer using additive compositing with distance-based range checking. The ***rendering pipeline*** runs continuously at the pixel clock, reading the framebuffer and converting cell values through the palette, gamma correction, brightness scaling, and mix stages.

The engine and renderer share the framebuffer BRAM read port. When the engine is active (during vertical blanking), it takes priority and the renderer outputs black. A four-stage busy pipeline ensures the engine mask is correctly aligned with the rendering delay.

:::note
The gamma correction at stage R3.5 applies a perceptual intensity curve (intensity²) that concentrates tonal steps in the dim range where the human eye is most sensitive. This produces smoother, more natural-looking fade-outs in the trail.
