## Overview

**Lumarian** is a comprehensive color correction and edge enhancement program. It combines a traditional ***proc amp*** (contrast and brightness), adjustable ***gamma*** curve, variable-frequency ***edge enhancement***, saturation control, inversions, and luminance threshold keying into a single processing chain. Each stage feeds the next, so adjustments at one point in the chain ripple through all downstream stages.

At subtle settings, Lumarian provides gentle color correction: a slight lift to contrast, a nudge to gamma, a touch of edge sharpening. At extreme settings, it becomes a dramatic image sculpting tool: crushed blacks, blazing highlights, razor-sharp edges folded into psychedelic shapes by the rectifier, and hard luminance keys that carve the image into bright islands floating in darkness.

:::note
Lumarian processes all three channels (Y, U, V) but its strongest personality lives in the luminance path. The six knobs sculpt brightness, contrast, tonal curves, and edge detail: the chroma controls complement that work without stealing focus.

### What's In a Name?

The name ***Lumarian*** blends ***luma***: the brightness component of a video signal: with the suffix *-arian*, suggesting one who studies or practices an art. A lumarian is a practitioner of light. There's also a nod to ***luminary***, a source of light or inspiration, and a hint of the mythic: ancient civilizations that mastered the mysteries of illumination.

## Quick Start

1. Feed a video source and turn **Contrast** (Knob 1) clockwise past the midpoint. The image gains punch as shadows deepen and highlights bloom.
2. Sweep **Gamma** (Knob 4) from one extreme to the other. Below center, midtones are crushed into shadow; above center, they are lifted toward brightness. Return to center for a neutral curve.
3. Turn up **Edge Gain** (Knob 5) while slowly increasing **Edge Cutoff** (Knob 6). Fine edges appear as bright halos around contours in the image.
4. Toggle **Luma Invert** (Switch 7). The entire luminance channel flips: what was bright becomes dark, and the edge enhancement and threshold stages respond to the inverted tones.

## Parameters

![Videomancer front panel with Lumarian loaded](/img/instruments/videomancer/lumarian/lumarian_control_panel.png)
*Videomancer's front panel with Lumarian active. Knobs 1–6 (top two rows of left cluster), Toggle switches 7–11 (bottom row of left cluster), Fader 12 (right side).*

### Knob 1 — Contrast

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0.0% – 200.0% |
| Default | 100.1% |

**Contrast** adjusts the gain applied to the luminance channel. At the center position (100.0%), the input passes through at unity gain. Turning counterclockwise toward 0.0% fades luminance toward a flat mid-gray. Turning clockwise toward 200.0% stretches the tonal range, blowing out highlights and crushing shadows. Contrast is the first processing stage, so its effect cascades through gamma, edge enhancement, and threshold.

:::tip
Contrast above 100% combined with a gentle **Gamma** adjustment is the fastest path to a punchy, cinematic look.
:::

---

### Knob 2 — Brightness

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | -1.000 – 1.000 |
| Default | 0.001 |

**Brightness** shifts the luminance channel up or down by adding a constant offset after the contrast gain stage. At the center position (0.000), no offset is applied. Turning counterclockwise toward −1.000 darkens the entire image uniformly. Turning clockwise toward 1.000 brightens it. Because brightness is applied after contrast, it shifts the entire tonal range without changing its spread.

---

### Knob 3 — Saturation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0.0% – 200.0% |
| Default | 100.1% |

**Saturation** controls the gain applied to both chrominance channels (U and V). At the center position (100.0%), color saturation is unchanged. Turning counterclockwise toward 0.0% fades color toward monochrome. Turning clockwise toward 200.0% intensifies colors, pushing them toward clipping.

:::note
The saturation proc amp uses a fixed brightness offset of 512 (mid-scale), which preserves the chroma zero-point. Saturation below the center position desaturates; above center, it oversaturates.
:::

---

### Knob 4 — Gamma

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | -2.000 – 2.000 |
| Default | 0.002 |

**Gamma** reshapes the luminance transfer curve. The processing stage generates two curves from a shared squarer: an ***exponential curve*** (input squared) and a ***logarithmic curve*** (inverted squared complement): and crossfades between them. At the center position (0.000), the two curves blend into a roughly linear response. Turning counterclockwise toward −2.000 applies the exponential curve, compressing midtones toward black. Turning clockwise toward 2.000 applies the logarithmic curve, lifting midtones toward white.

:::tip
Gamma is the most powerful tonal control. A small adjustment around center yields natural-looking correction. Extreme values create dramatic contrast curves that reveal hidden detail in shadows or highlights.
:::

---

### Knob 5 — Edge Gain

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0.0% – 200.0% |
| Default | 0.0% |

**Edge Gain** controls the amplitude of the edge enhancement signal. At 0.0%, no enhancement is applied and the signal passes through from the gamma stage unchanged. Increasing the value toward 200.0% progressively amplifies high-frequency detail extracted by the variable filter, adding bright halos along contours. The edge signal is scaled by a ***differential multiplier*** and blended back into the image.

---

### Knob 6 — Edge Cutoff

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0.0% – 100.0% |
| Default | 0.0% |

**Edge Cutoff** sets the frequency threshold for the variable high-pass filter inside the edge enhancement stage. At 0.0%, only the finest, highest-frequency edges are extracted. Increasing the value toward 100.0% lowers the cutoff, admitting progressively broader spatial frequencies. At high values, large-scale contrast transitions are treated as "edges," producing a more dramatic, poster-like enhancement.

:::warning
High **Edge Gain** combined with low **Edge Cutoff** amplifies very fine detail and noise. With a noisy source, start with a moderate cutoff before increasing gain.
:::

---

### Switch 7 — Luma Invert

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Luma Invert** applies a bitwise complement to the luminance channel. When set to **On**, every pixel's brightness is flipped: bright becomes dark and dark becomes bright. This inversion occurs *after* the edge enhancement stage but *before* the threshold key, so it reverses the luminance values that the threshold compares against.

---

### Switch 8 — Chroma Invert

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Chroma Invert** applies a bitwise complement to both U and V chrominance channels simultaneously. When set to **On**, colors shift to their complementary hues: reds become cyan, blues become yellow, greens become magenta. Chroma inversion happens early in the pipeline, before the saturation proc amp, so the inverted colors are then scaled by the **Saturation** control.

---

### Switch 9 — Edge Invert

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Edge Invert** flips the polarity of the edge enhancement signal within the rectifier stage. When set to **On**, bright edge halos become dark edge grooves, and vice versa. This toggle modifies bit 0 of the 3-bit rectifier mode, working in combination with **Edge Rectify** and **Edge Select** to produce eight distinct edge shaping behaviors.

---

### Switch 10 — Edge Rectify

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Off |
| On | On |
| Default | Off |

**Edge Rectify** enables full-wave rectification of the edge signal. When set to **On**, the rectifier folds the negative portion of the high-pass filter's output up to become positive, doubling the visible edge frequency: a "both sides of the edge" effect where every contour shows as a bright line regardless of the direction of the luminance transition.

---

### Switch 11 — Edge Select

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Off | Single |
| On | Both |
| Default | Single |

**Edge Select** chooses between single-edge and dual-edge modes. When set to **Single**, the edge enhancement responds to only one polarity of luminance transition: either light-to-dark or dark-to-light depending on the **Edge Invert** setting. When set to **Both**, both polarities produce visible edge lines. This toggle modifies bit 2 of the 3-bit rectifier mode, enabling half-wave rectification behavior.

---

### Fader 12 — Luma Blank

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Range | 0.0% – 100.0% |
| Default | 0.0% |

**Luma Blank** applies a luminance threshold key at the final stage of the processing chain. At 0.0%, all pixels pass through. As the value increases toward 100.0%, pixels whose luminance falls below the threshold are replaced with black (Y=0) and neutral color (U=V=512). At high values, only the brightest areas of the image survive.

:::tip
**Luma Blank** interacts powerfully with **Gamma**. Use gamma to reshape the brightness distribution, then use the threshold to carve the result into a luminance key mask. Combine with **Edge Gain** to produce glowing edge outlines floating over black.

## Background

### The proc amp

A ***processing amplifier***, or proc amp, is the most fundamental building block in analog and digital video processing. It applies two operations to a signal: gain (contrast) and offset (brightness). The formula is `output = (input − midpoint) × contrast / midpoint + brightness`. Lumarian's luminance proc amp is the first stage in the processing chain, setting the tonal foundation for everything that follows. The saturation proc amp uses the same math on U and V, with a fixed brightness offset at mid-scale to preserve the chroma zero-point.

### Gamma correction

***Gamma*** describes the nonlinear relationship between signal value and perceived brightness. In the physical world, doubling the voltage in a CRT display more than doubles the brightness because the phosphor response follows a power law. Gamma correction compensates for this curve (or intentionally distorts it for creative effect.)

Lumarian's gamma stage doesn't use a lookup table or a true power function. Instead, it approximates gamma curves algebraically by computing two shapes: an exponential curve (the input squared, which compresses midtones) and a logarithmic curve (the complement squared and subtracted from maximum, which expands midtones). A crossfade interpolator blends between these two curves based on the control value. The result is a smoothly adjustable transfer curve that reshapes the midtone distribution.

### Edge enhancement

Edge enhancement, also called ***unsharp masking*** in photography, sharpens an image by emphasizing transitions between adjacent tonal regions. Lumarian extracts edges using a ***variable high-pass filter***: a filter whose cutoff frequency is adjustable via the **Edge Cutoff** control. The high-pass output contains only the rapid transitions in the image. This edge signal is then shaped by a ***complex rectifier*** that can invert, half-wave rectify, or full-wave rectify the signal in eight combinations, and finally scaled by a ***differential multiplier*** controlled by **Edge Gain** before being blended back into the image.

## Signal Flow

### Signal Flow Notes

Two key structural details:

1. **Y path dominates latency.** The luminance chain passes through three heavyweight processing blocks: proc amp (9 cycles), gamma (squarer + interpolator, ~14 cycles), and edge enhance (filter + rectifier + multiplier, ~18 cycles): for a total processing latency of roughly 47 clock cycles. The chroma channels are much shorter (invert + proc amp + delay), so a 33-stage delay line aligns U/V with the Y output. The sync path uses a matched 47-stage shift register.

2. **Edge enhancement is a parallel blend.** The enhance stage does not simply add edges to the signal. It runs the gamma output through a variable filter to extract high-frequency content, shapes it through the rectifier, then uses a differential multiplier to blend the shaped edge signal back with the original. When Edge Gain is zero, the original passes through unchanged. When Edge Gain is high, edges are amplified and added.

:::tip
**Order matters.** Contrast and brightness shape the raw signal, gamma reshapes the curve, edges are extracted from the gamma-corrected signal, inversion is applied last before threshold. Each stage transforms what the next stage sees.

![Inverted Luminance Key result](/img/instruments/videomancer/lumarian/lumarian_ex3_s1.png)
*Inverted Luminance Key — simulated result across source images.*
#### Exercise Illustration

***A description of the exercise illustration.***

#### Learning Outcomes

Combine gamma curves, inversion, and threshold keying to create a luminance key mask.

#### Key Concepts

- Gamma extremes create dramatic contrast curves
- Luma Invert flips the tonal map, changing what the threshold keeps
- Chroma Invert shifts hues to their complements

#### Video Source

High-contrast footage such as silhouettes, text on a background, or stage lighting.

#### Steps

1. **Crush with gamma**: Turn **Gamma** (Knob 4) fully counterclockwise. Midtones collapse into shadows, leaving only the brightest highlights.
2. **Boost contrast**: Set **Contrast** (Knob 1) to about 160% to amplify the stark gamma curve.
3. **Add edge detail**: Set **Edge Gain** (Knob 5) to about 60% and **Edge Cutoff** (Knob 6) to about 30%. Edges appear as thin bright lines in the gamma-crushed image.
4. **Invert luminance**: Toggle **Luma Invert** (Switch 7) to **On**. The crushed shadows become bright fields; the surviving highlights become dark. The edge lines also invert.
5. **Invert chroma**: Toggle **Chroma Invert** (Switch 8) to **On**. Colors shift to complementary hues.
6. **Key threshold**: Increase **Luma Blank** (Fader 12) until only the desired tonal regions remain. With both inversions active, the threshold carves into the flipped image.
