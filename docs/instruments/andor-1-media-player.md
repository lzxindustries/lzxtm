# Andor 1 Media Player

A versatile standalone media player for video art, stage production, video walls, signage, NFT display, and other applications. Plays seamless video loops or shows still images. Media can be easily switched with a single key press on a USB keyboard/remote or MIDI keyboard, or the optional remote control. Multiple units used together can wirelessly synchronize the playback of video files across multiple screens.

The Andor 1 is incredibly simple to use, but packed with professional features like an integrated playlist editor that supports interactive playlists, video wall modes with bezel compensation, MIDI control, video rotation options, and built-in video color test patterns. It's small enough to easily fit behind most TVs and monitors, and in some cases it can be powered from a TV's USB port.

Andor 1 was developed by programmer, artist, and curator Paul Slocum and is based on more than a decade of exhibiting video and digital art at his own And/Or Gallery and at other museums and galleries internationally.

Effortless Looping and Synchronizing of Videos

Just plug in a USB drive containing your video. The only configuration required is to ensure players are on the same sync channel (which they are by default), and sync still works even if your videos are slightly different lengths. Supports dozens of sync channels to avoid interference when multiple synchronized installations are operating in the same area.

Built For Art and Other Creative Displays

Boots and plays media in seconds with no text or logos. Truly seamless video looping. Native support for a variety of computer and TV monitor resolutions and aspect ratios. It does what artists always wish media players did.

Powerful Playlist System

The simple integrated playlist editor allows you to string together sequences of multiple videos or images. It even includes the ability to link playlist items to MIDI notes or keys on the remote control, allowing synchronized video loops to be triggered across multiple screens from a single remote or MIDI device.
