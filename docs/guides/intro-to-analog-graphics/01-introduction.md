## Introduction

Video synthesis is hard. If you are coming to it from the audio world, like I was, some concepts will transfer over,
but video has a host of idiosyncrasies and terminology all its own. Sometimes an apparently simple term can even
signal many related but subtly different concepts
1,2
.
There are some informational resources available—the LZX Website, Forums (especially this Getting started with
video synthesis thread), Discord, 3 Patches videos, and Twitch streams; Johnny Woods’s Guide to the LZX
Visionary PDF; Dr. Yo’s video explainers; this table of colors and their corresponding R/G/B voltages—but all this
information is scattered and can sometimes be a bit on the technical side or assume a certain level of prior
knowledge, which can be daunting or inaccessible if you are just starting out. In writing and illustrating this
document, I wanted to make the beginner’s guide that I wish I had when I was first starting out. To try and digest
and compile and centralize all the information out there into one easy-to-reference document.
This guide is concerned almost exclusively with shape and pattern generation (“shapegen”), as that is what I know
and what I use my modules for. I always find it helpful to ground conceptual or technical explanations with
concrete examples, so this guide is built around specific patches that are possible to follow with currently
available-to-purchase modules, and the various approaches are synthesized at the very end into a small final
composition (Figure 19).
