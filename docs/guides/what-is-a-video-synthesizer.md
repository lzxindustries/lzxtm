# What Is A Video Synthesizer?

:::warning
This documentation site is a work in progress, and all details are subject to change before the official launch.
:::

A video synthesizer is an electronic instrument which creates or processes video images in real time. A modular video synthesizer is comprised of one or more electronic modules. Each module performs a specific function, such as shape generation or color mixing. Modules are connected to each other with patch cables in an open ended manner which encourages experimentation and offers a wholly immersive creative experience. A large system of modules may be purchased at once, or it may be built up over time, according to an artistâ€™s specific creative goals.
