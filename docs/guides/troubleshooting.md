**I suspect something is not working. What are some good troubleshooting steps to follow?** Keep it simple. Simplify your patch to the least number of cables or connections that create the issue you're seeing. Sometimes this will reveal the problem. If you jump into more complex theories right away, you may miss simple answers, like a defective patch cable or a missed setting.

**Your 12V power supply or EuroRack power supply may not be supplying enough current.** Underpowering your system can result in a variety of glitchy behavior. Add up the current consumption required by your LZX modules or by any other modules sharing the same power source, and verify that this is less than the current supplied by your power supply. If it is very close to, or greater than, the supplied current, upgrade your power supply.

**Try testing modules in isolation.** Disconnect all modules from your system, and connect only the output module, such as ESG3, to the power supply. After verifying it works correctly, power up the next module. Keep going until your issue reappears. If the issue reappears near the power supply's limits, upgrade your power supply. If the issue seems to be connected to a specific module, focus on troubleshooting that module.
I am seeing my LZX Modular system's video output drop in and out on my video monitor or video recording device, resulting in missing frames.

**Your video device might be defective.** Verify that your video device can display video signals from a different video source of the same video format, using a different set of video cables. If you see the same issue, your device is defective. Contact the manufacturer of your video device for advice on further troubleshooting.

**Your video cables might be defective.** Try with another set of video cables. If your issue has been resolved with the new cables, your video cables were defective.

**Your video cables might be too long.** Try with another set of video cables no longer than 2 meters in length. If this resolves your issue, use the shorter cables. If you require a very long cable run, you may need to add a video distribution amplifier to your equipment list.
