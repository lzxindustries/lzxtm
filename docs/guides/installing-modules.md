# Installing Modules

:::warning
This documentation site is a work in progress, and all content is subject to change before the official launch.
:::

Installing a new module in your system should be done in the following steps. Always power down your system while installing a new module.

## Connecting Power
Your power supply must be connected to either the 12V DC input jack or the EuroRack power connector. Do not use both connectors at the same time.

## Connecting Video Sync
For each module with a Video Sync In on the rear, it must be connected to your ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator module using an RCA cable. This connection may be made directly, or through a chain of other modules. ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator may be connected to other ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator modules in this manner, or its video sync input may be left disconnected.

Secure the module to your EuroRack mounting rails using the screws provided by your EuroRack case provider.
