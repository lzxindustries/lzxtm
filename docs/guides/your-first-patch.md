# Your First Patch

:::warning
This documentation site is a work in progress, and all content is subject to change before the official launch.
:::

This patch assumes you have followed the module installation instructions above, and your LZX Modular system is powered on.

Here's what you will need:

ESG3 Encoder & Sync Generator module
DSG3 Dual Shape Generator module
An RCA-to-RCA cable for composite video output
A video display with composite video input
Three 3.5mm patch cables

### Initial Settings

All toggle switches on ESG3 and DSG3 should be reset to their center (middle) position. All knobs on ESG3 should be set to their detented (middle) position.

Turn all of ESG3's front DIP switches to their OFF position. If you want NTSC output, leave them all OFF. If you want PAL output, turn switch #1 to the ON position.

### Connecting A Video Display

Connect your video display's CVBS input to your ESG3 Video Encoder & Sync Generator module's CVBS output.

### Generating A Color Pattern

Patch any three of DSG3's eight outputs to your ESG3's Red, Green & Blue input jacks. Play with the knobs and switches on ESG3 and DSG3, exploring the capabilities of your patternmaking patch. Patch different outputs from DSG3 to observe different combinations.

### Adding Complexity

Next, let's make the geometry of your pattern capable of more complex results through series processing. Patch two outputs from DSG3's first shape generator, to the inputs of it's second shape generator. Now take your RGB pattern from the second shape generator's outputs.
