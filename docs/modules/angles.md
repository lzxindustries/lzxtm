## Overview

ANGLES is a dual horizontal and vertical ramp generator and 24-output fixed ratio mixer. That may not sound very exciting at first, but ANGLES is the key to a full range of dynamic compositions in video synthesis.

Horizontal and vertical waveforms are essential ingredients in most generative patches. But with standard H and V ramps and oscillators, patches can feel constrained within a box. Shapes and patterns are oriented parallel or perpendicular to the video frame. Compositions are visually static even when they're animated, because all geometry is based on right angle relationships. That's fine if you want the feeling of the patch to be solid and constant. However, for lively, dynamic compositions, we need geometries oriented along diagonals.

Synthesizing complex geometries, such as vanishing points or polygons, requires diagonally oriented ramps. ANGLES accomplishes this by mixing H and V ramps in fixed proportions. It lets your patch break out of the box with 24 individual ramps rotated in 15-degree increments. Instead of being limited to 0 and 90 degrees, you can now pick any two angles. 24 options for each of the two paired ramps gives over 500 creative alternatives to the ordinary HV ramp combo.

## System Integration Advice

Angles is a great support module to add to a system including one or more of the following: DSG3, DWO3, Stairs, and Keychain. It really shines in systems where its outputs can be distributed throughout the patch to multiple destinations.

---

## Controls, Connectors & Indicators

<img src={angles_controls_and_connectors} alt="ANGLES controls and connections" />

&nbsp;<br />
Angles is populated with 32 jacks. The top row of jacks are ramp outputs: horizontal, vertical, inverted horizontal, and inverted vertical. 

<img src={angles_ramp_generator_outputs} alt="ANGLES H and V ramp outputs" />

&nbsp;<br />
These ramps are internally normalled into the **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D** input jacks on the second row. If nothing is patched into an input jack, a ramp provides the source to the mixing stages below.

<img src={angles_normalled_connections} alt="ANGLES internal normalling" />

---

## Operation

Each of the 24 outputs is a unique mix of two of the A, B, C, and D inputs. Pairs of sources are mixed at ratios of 1:0, 5:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:5. This results in mixtures of:

- 100% & 0% 
- 83.3% & 16.7% 
- 66.7% & 33.3%
- 50% & 50%
- 33.3% & 66.7%
- 16.7% & 83.3%

<img src={angles_fixed_ratio_outputs} alt="ANGLES fixed ratio outputs" />
&nbsp;<br />

When two ramps are mixed, the result is an angled ramp. Different starting orientations and mixing amounts give different angles. ANGLES splits the circle in 24 equal sections, outputting 24 differently angled ramps, in rotational increments of 15 degrees.

<img src={angles_15_135_255_300} alt="ANGLES rotated ramps" />
&nbsp;<br />

But ANGLES is not limited to its internal ramps. Any video or control signal can be mixed with any other signal. This opens up interesting possibilities, such as symmetrical mixes of two sources. For example, one mix of 66.&% A and 33.3% B, and a complementary mix of 33.3% A and 66.7% B.

## Example Patches

### Waveshape Expander

Patch  DWO3 or DSG3 outputs into ANGLES inputs to expand the available waveforms.

---

### Spatial Reference

Patch any two outputs from ANGLES into DSG3 to completely change the orientation of its generated patterns.

<img src={angles_45_degree_tilt} alt="ANGLES patch: DSG3 orientation"/>

---

### Oscillator Protractor

Patch outputs from ANGLES into DWO3 inputs to frequency modulate its waveforms at different angles.

<img src={angles_dwo3_cv} alt="ANGLES patch: oscillator frequency modulation" />

---

### Complex Color Field

Use any three outputs from ANGLES as RGB channels to create a complex color gradient. This can be a direct visual element or a source of modulation.

<img src={angles_rgb_gradient} alt="ANGLES patch: complex color gradient" />

---

### Quadrature Expander

Patch a quadrature oscillator into ANGLES' four inputs to create a full spread of 24 different output phases.

---

### Hierarchical Spatial Reference

Patch any four outputs to the inputs of a second ANGLES module for a completely different set of 24 angles or mixer ratios.

## Installation

<!-- Discuss differences between 10 and 16 pin connectors -->

<img src={angles_mounting_power_sync} alt="ANGLES installation" />

### Requirements

* EuroRack enclosure.
* 12V DC or EuroRack power supply.
* 2.1mm DC barrel power cable **or** a EuroRack power cable (both options included).
* Four M2.5 x 6mm mounting screws, or screws provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.
* #1 Phillips head screwdriver, or hand tool provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.

### Procedure

* Power off and disconnect the EuroRack enclosure's power supply and any attached DC adapters.
* Connect either the EuroRack Power Cable **or** the DC Barrel Power Cable to the module. Do not connect both Eurorack and DC Barrel power.
* Ensure that no mounting screws are in any holes in the area where you wish to mount the module.
* Carefully test fit the module with its attached power cable in the open space in the EuroRack enclosure. If it is obstructed by the enclosure or any internal assemblies, abort this procedure.
* Connect the disconnected end of the power cable to the power supply.
* Connect the sync cable to a sync source or the last module in the sync chain.
* Mount the module to the EuroRack rails using all mounting holes.
* Store the unused cable along with the product box in a safe location. 
* Power on the EuroRack enclosure and start patching.

## Full Specifications

<!-- AFR note: the following illustration is a screen capture from the product page. It should probably be recreated at full resolution, therefore I've given it the filename 'angles_line_art_labeled_placeholder_330x684.png' -->

<!-- AFR note: Markdown doesn't support inline tables, so I was forced to use HTML -->

<!-- AFR note: there were clerical errors on the product page where I got the front panel function info. J29 was listed as 165 degrees, the same as J30. J29 should be 75 degrees, right? Also, J23 was out of order.-->
