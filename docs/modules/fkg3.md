| Included          | DC barrel power cable, EuroRack power cable, RCA sync cable                     |

## System Integration Advice

May be expanded by utility modules such as Proc and Matte, becoming the core unit of a color correction and key source processing subsystem.

## Controls, Connectors & Indicators

## Operation

Analogue logic based keying modes: Luma Key, Chroma Key Red, Chroma Key Green, and Chroma Key Blue. Softness control sweeps edge response from hard transitions to soft gradients.  Patch in monochromatic sources seamlessly via switched RGB input jacks.

## Example Patches

## Installation

<!-- Something about making sure all screws have been removed from the intended mounting location. -->

### Requirements

* EuroRack enclosure.
* 12V DC or EuroRack power supply.
* 2.1mm DC barrel power cable **or** a EuroRack power cable (both options included).
* Four M2.5 x 6mm mounting screws, or screws provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.
* #1 Phillips head screwdriver, or hand tool provided or specified by the enclosure manufacturer.

### Procedure

* Power off and disconnect the EuroRack enclosure's power supply and any attached DC adapters.
* Connect only one of, the EuroRack Power Cable or the DC Barrel Power Cable to the module. 
* Carefully test fit the module with its attached power cable in the open space in the EuroRack enclosure. If it is obstructed by the enclosure or any internal assemblies, abort this procedure.
* Connect the disconnected end of the power cable to the power supply.
* Connect the sync cable to your sync source or the last module in your sync chain
* Mount the module to the EuroRack rails using all mounting holes.
* Store the unused cable along with the product box in a safe location. 
* Power on the EuroRack enclosure and start patching.
